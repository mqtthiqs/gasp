% A package for automatically collecting proofs and moving them to a separate place.
% A more elaborate version of this package (`preuve.sty') leaves a pointer in a margin paragraph.

% This package assumes that a ``proof'' environment is already defined, and that this environment
% accepts an optional label. It alters its definition so that proofs may be moved if desired.
% It also adds an invocation of \locallabelreset at the beginning of every proof.
% (Hard to do this elsewhere, because of the optional label.)

% This package assumes that ``theorem'' and ``lemma'' environments are already defined, and alters
% their definitions so that the ``proof'' environment that follows may be moved.

\ProvidesPackage{preuve-modeste}[2005/07/08]

% We rely on exercise.sty by Didier Rémy.
\RequirePackage{exercise}

% This code, executed at the beginning of every theorem, defines \lastthm to the name of the current
% theorem, to be used when typesetting the proof that follows.

% Modify the ``theorem'' and ``lemma'' environments so that the above two patches are invoked.
