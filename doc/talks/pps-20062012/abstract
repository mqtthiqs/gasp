Certificates for incremental type checking

A lightweight way to design a trusted type-checker is to let it return
a certificate of well-typing, and check it a posteriori (for instance
Agda and GHC adopt this architecture internally). Most of the time,
these type-checkers are confronted sequentially with very similar
pieces of input: the same program, each time slightly modified. Yet
they rebuild the entire certificates, even for unchanged parts of the
code. Instead of discarding them between runs, we can take advantage
of these certificates to improve the reactivity of type-checking, by
feeding parts of the certificates for unchanged parts of the original
program back into the new input, thus building an incremental
type-checker. We present a language-independent framework making
possible to turn a type system and its certifying checking algorithm
into a safe, incremental one. It consists in a model of incrementality
by sharing, a generic data structure to represent reusable derivations
based on Contextual LF, and a general-purpose language to write
certifying programs.
